- focus is more on exploratory data analysis than building an MVP in a weekend

## What are we Doing?

- any planning data-related thing you want, really
  - housing
  - equity
  - transportation
  - land use
  - economic development
  - etc.
- but we have selected one central theme

# Metadata for Planning Documents

## Types of Planning Documents

- Comprehensive Plans
- Functional Plans
- Subarea Plans
- Corridor Plans
- Complete Streets Plans
- Hazard Mitigation and Disaster Recovery Plans
- Arts and Culture Plans
- and many more!

-----

- Even plans with "limited" scope typically involve an enormous amount of work that require collaboration among multiple organizations
  - data collection, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing
  - stakeholder engagement
  - drafting, editing, tracking changes, soliciting feedback and comments, publishing

## And when it's finally "done", we get...

- printed volumes, which aren't cheap to print in large quantities
  - that usually end up collecting dust on a shelf in some windowless basement room somewhere
- gigantic PDFs, links to which can be hard to find and/or 404 after a while

## So much work goes in to creating documents that end up being far less useful than they could be

## What if someone wanted to...

- Find corridor plans that mention bicycle infrastructure in cities between 50k-250k in population published in the last 20 years?
- List the quantifiable attributes of recommendations from a hazard mitigation plan that were implemented in areas before a disaster struck to evaluate their effectiveness after the disaster struck?

-----

- Find plans that include the topics of sprawl, infill development, and farmland preservation in specific geographic areas, then compare before-and-after satellite photos of those areas?

*These would all be extremely tedious and time-consuming to do currently*

# Similar Precedents

## GTFS

- [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/)
  - the "G" used to stand for Google, because they needed a machine-readable format of transit routes and schedules for use in Google Maps
  - so they created a standard format to allow transit agencies to self-publish their routes and schedules to enable transit directions on Google Maps
